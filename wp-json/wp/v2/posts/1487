Suffice to say, lots of things have changed this year. One of these changes, for many of us, was being propelled into a more sedentary lifestyle. The small bits of activity that added up in our daily lives, such as walking to school or work, were no longer the norm.\u00a0 <\/span> [\/et_pb_text][et_pb_image src=&#8221;https:\/\/www.uplaysports.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/IMG_20200721_112910-scaled.jpg&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.4.0&#8243; custom_margin=&#8221;||1px|||&#8221;][\/et_pb_image][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.4.0&#8243;]An unfamiliar sight: courts empty during lockdown.<br \/>\n[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row column_structure=&#8221;1_2,1_2&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.4.0&#8243;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_2&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.4.0&#8243;][et_pb_image src=&#8221;https:\/\/www.uplaysports.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Reccomended-activity-levels_FaceBook.png&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.4.0&#8243;][\/et_pb_image][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_2&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.4.0&#8243;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.4.0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the lockdown, the number of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">children reaching their activity targets fell from 47% to just 19%.(1)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For adults, the story was a little more complex. Some were doing more exercise than before lockdown whilst others were managing less. However, since the lifting of the restrictions, those meeting the recommended weekly levels trended downwards. 32% during the initial lockdown period (March-May) became 24% by the end of October.(2)\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amongst all these many changes, one thing that has remained the same is the importance of regular physical activity in supporting physical and mental health. This relationship is one we are all becoming more familiar with. On average 63% of adults said they used exercise as a tool for supporting their mental health during the lockdown.(3)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this second lockdown, it is important that we remember this relationship, and try to prioritise some form of daily physical activity. With the closing down of sports facilities up and down the country we want to continue to support you with ways to keep active during this difficult time. The benefits of physical activity don&#8217;t end when you step off the court after one of our classes or camps, and we don&#8217;t want our positive impact to do so either.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.4.0&#8243;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.4.0&#8243;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.4.0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have put together some resources to help you get active every day, we think they are too good not to share.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>uPlay Sports Challenges<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last lockdown our coaches came up with some challenges for you to have a go at, at home.
