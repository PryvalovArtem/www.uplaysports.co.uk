This is primarily delivered through courses and clubs, schools, local venues and extends to day camps during school holidays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">uPlay Sports are committed to supporting all young people to enjoy and excel in sporting activities and fully recognise our duty of care towards young and vulnerable people. We fully recognise children need a safe, protective and nurturing environment if they are to fulfil their potential, which in turn provides reassurance to parents that their children will be happy and safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The uPlay Sports policy is informed by the government guidance \u2018Working Together to\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Safeguard Children \u2013 a guide to inter-agency working to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, HM Government 2015\u2019. This guidance, which is applicable in England, sets out the legislative requirements and expectations on individual services to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and provides the framework to which Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs) monitor the effectiveness of local services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">As part of our safeguarding policy we will:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Promote and prioritise the safety and wellbeing of children and young people.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Ensure everyone understands their roles and responsibilities in respect of safeguarding and is<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>provided with appropriate learning opportunities to recognise, identify and respond to signs of abuse, neglect and other safeguarding concerns relating to children and young people.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Ensure appropriate action is taken in the event of incidents\/concerns of abuse and support provided to the individual(s) who raise or disclose the concern.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Ensure that confidential, detailed and accurate records of all safeguarding concerns are maintained and securely stored.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Ensure robust safeguarding arrangements and procedures are in operation.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p8\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Missing Persons<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\">In the rare event that a child or vulnerable adult goes missing from an activity, we have clear guidelines to outline the actions that should be taken. This is briefed to all of our team and sits within our Safeguarding Policy, our emergency procedures are available at all of our venues for staff to follow in the unlikely event this situation should arise.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Confidentiality Agreement<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Our staff are trained to deal with confidential data in a sensitive manner.

Our code of behaviour is discussed by our Head Coach at the start of day camp to ensure all children are clear on what is expected of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We strive to encourage good behaviour and ensure each child has a positive experience within our camps. Staff are trained to intervene should any negative behaviour compromise the atmosphere within camp. Our preferred choice is to correct such behaviour and explain why this is important, setting goals to help the child correct negative behaviour. If the situation does not improve, regrettably we may have to exclude the child from camp.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Equal Opportunities &amp; Diversity<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p11\"><span class=\"s1\">We are committed to create an environment in which individual differences and the contributions of all our coaches and Children are recognised and valued.

We are unable to accept any children who are ill as this is unfair to other camp members and our coaching team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p11\"><span class=\"s1\">During Extreme weather conditions, suitable clothing \/ sun protection is required. Please ensure during hot weather sun cream is applied before your child is dropped off at camp and ensure your child knows how to reapply suncream as necessary throughout the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p6\"><strong>Nut-Free Policy<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Although we recognise that this cannot be guaranteed, uPlay Sports camps aim to be a\u00a0Nut-Free environment. This\u00a0policy\u00a0serves to set out all measures to reduce the risk to those children and adults who may suffer an anaphylactic reaction if exposed to\u00a0nuts.<\/p>\n<p>We ask that children attending sessions and camps do not bring in\u00a0nuts\u00a0or\u00a0nut-related products as snacks or in their packed lunch. Our \u201cNut-Free Policy\u201d means that the following items\u00a0<strong>should not<\/strong>\u00a0be brought in:<\/p>\n<p>Packs of nuts ; Peanut butter sandwiches ; Fruit and cereal bars that contain nuts ; Chocolate bars or sweets that contain nuts ; Sesame seed rolls (children allergic to nuts may also have a severe reaction to sesame); Cakes made with nuts<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Health and Safety Policy<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p11\"><span class=\"s1\">uPlay Sports set out a commitment to achieving good standards of health and safety for all our participants and coaches through clear and well communicated policies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p11\"><span class=\"s1\">Our aim is to make quality sports coaching available to as many people as possible.
