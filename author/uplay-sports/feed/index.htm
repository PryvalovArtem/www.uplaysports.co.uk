				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">Indoor break is no fun for teachers. This is partly because it’s harder to set up the classroom for the next lesson or get some marking done, but mainly because teachers instinctively understand that children need the time to move around and prepare their brains for learning.</p>
<p>A growing body of research by cognitive neurologists backs this up, showing that there is increased brain activity and improved on-task behaviours when tackling cognitive tasks following a period of being physically active.</p>
<p>Even with these known benefits, it can be difficult to provide children with regular opportunities to be physically active within the school day, and even harder to ensure they achieve the recommended 30 minutes of in-school moderate-to-vigorous activity every day. One solution is physically active learning (PAL) – an innovative teaching and learning approach that integrates movement into the learning experience.</p>
<p>Maths on the Move (MOTM) is an example of PAL, and covers the KS1 and KS2 National Curriculum for Maths in a physically active manner. In 2019/2020, Leeds Beckett University (LBU) carried out an independent evaluation of the programme, with the following themes emerging through their research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</div>
			</div>
			</div>
				
				
				
				
			</div><div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_3">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_3  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><strong>1) PAL boosts physical activity and reduces sedentary time</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, reports suggest that physical activity levels in children are at an all-time low. In order to combat sedentary behaviour, PAL sessions integrate curriculum-based content with physical activities.</p>
<p>The LBU evaluation showed that a single 45-minute MOTM session allowed children to accumulate 6.4 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity and 19.8 minutes of light physical activity, whilst reducing sedentary activity by 9.5 minutes. This meant that 28% more children met the recommended amount of activity on a day which includes a PAL session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2) Facilitates learning and understanding</strong></p>
<p>The LBU evaluation of MOTM was unique in that it examined whether children made progress in a defined area of the KS2 Maths National Curriculum.</p>
<p>By undertaking the MOTM Year 5 Fractions and Decimals programme for 6 weeks, children who attended improved their test scores from 11.3 out of 25 to 18 out of 25. In contrast, the children who continued with their normal classroom-based lessons improved from 10.1 out of 25 to 11 out of 25 – a marked difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3) Increases concentration and time on task in other lessons</strong></p>
<p>Many teachers already use brain breaks or energisers to reinvigorate the children in their class and even a short amount of physical activity has been seen to have a positive impact on concentration and attention.</p>
<p>Teachers felt that MOTM sessions provided a similar reprieve to an active break: “They come back in really calm, and it’s nice to see actually they’ve had that energy, but they’ve concentrated.” This indicates that embedding physically active learning sessions in the curriculum can benefit other timetabled lessons in the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4) Increases confidence and reduces anxiety</strong></p>
<p>For children who fear maths or have low self-esteem in their ability to think mathematically, changing the learning environment can have a profound effect. By placing the emphasis on learning through games in PAL sessions, children feel more at ease getting involved, allowing them to grow in confidence.</p>
<p>Back in the classroom, children were able to make links between the understanding gained in the PAL lesson and classroom-based learning. Children expressed that they now had more confidence in answering questions, feeling that they knew the answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5) Improves resilience</strong></p>
<p>Building resilience in children is of vital importance and there are many advocates for the role of physical activity in supporting children in becoming resilient.</p>
<p>Teachers observed noticeable changes back in the classroom for pupils who had attended MOTM sessions: “In terms of their attitudes towards learning, they seem more resilient and a lot more confident, and they don’t have any tears if they can’t answer any of the questions. They just persevere with it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6) A more inclusive approach</strong></p>
<p>Combining maths and physical activity allows children to become more immersed in both the physical activities and the maths challenges. Teachers felt that children who usually engaged with physical activity but not maths, were more involved and vice versa: “Those that don’t like Maths, they&#8217;re hooked by the moving, and those that like Maths anyway, they&#8217;re just happy to do Maths as well as something else.”</p>
<p>Some pupils who usually believed they were “not that good at sport” felt that they were included more than usual. With that in mind, PAL can prevent isolation by “allowing everyone to get involved and take part in the sessions”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7) Allows for collaboration and team work</strong></p>
<p>PE lessons often provide opportunities for children to work together but maths lessons tend to involve less teamwork. By grouping children in PAL sessions, you can offer the chance for children to discuss and share their maths understanding, allowing them to give and receive feedback and understand different perspectives.</p>
<p>It also provides healthy competition between teams which draws out the importance of working as a team: “We had to work as a team because you had to interact with other people to know what they got.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any intervention that is not well received by the children will struggle to maintain its position in a busy timetable and is unlikely to have a positive impact.</p>
<p>Children who took part in the MOTM programme really wanted to continue with the sessions after the programme had concluded, saying: “I think it would be really good if it continues because it’s really fun and always gets me awake for the day” and “If it continues, it will help us learn more Maths, it would help us generate even better grades”.</p>
<p>In summary, the data to support physically active learning is compelling, and the accompanying feedback from both children and teachers provides a deep and insightful exploration into how this can work in schools practically.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning maths whilst being physically active. It definitely sounds like fun, but does it really </span><b>work</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">? The short answer is yes, it does. A six-week study conducted by academics at Leeds Beckett University has concluded that the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maths on the Move (MOTM)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> programme both improves maths attainment and increases physical activity levels.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study, conducted prior to lockdown at the end of 2019, compared outcomes for children taking part in a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOTM</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> programme against control groups who continued with traditional classroom-style maths lessons. All </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOTM</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sessions were delivered by experienced Aspire-trained educators.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Children wore accelerometers during the school day to measure their physical activity.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This enabled researchers to find out how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOTM </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">affected children’s chances of meeting the in-school activity target of 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the control group:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">28% more children achieved the recommended physical activity levels in a school day.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average children secured an additional 5 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and 5.7 minutes of light physical activity.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a reduction of 9.5 minutes of inactive time. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even prior to lockdown, less than half of children were achieving the Chief Medical Officer’s recommendations around physical activity and the figure has worsened throughout the pandemic. The results of this study show that physically active learning can help to fix this problem. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>So, we can increase activity, but what about maths performance? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers measured maths performance using tests before and at the end of the programme. Maths attainment test performance </span><b>significantly improved</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over time for children on the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOTM</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> programme when compared to the control groups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scores for children on the MOTM programme increased from a baseline average score of 11.3/25 (45.2%) to 18.1/25 (72.4%). The scores for the control groups increased from 10.1/25 (40.4%) to 11/25 (44%) over the same period of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These findings support our own year-long study across the academic year 2019 – 2020, where</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">93% of children demonstrated an improvement in maths performance </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% of children also reported an increase in confidence relating to maths.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read more about that study <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.uplaysports.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MOTM-Analysis-2019-20-uPlay.pdf">here.</a></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Researchers found that </b><b><i>MOTM</i></b><b> was an overwhelmingly positive experience for schools. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what some of the children and their teachers had to say: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel excited and happy, I feel this because we get to do fun activities and learn about Maths</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” – Aisha, Year 5 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like sports but … I also like Maths a bit&#8230; I like them all together and it’s really fun because you … challenge each other</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Sana, Year 5</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Maths on the Move is part of your curriculum, it would have an impact on the general enjoyment of Maths” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Shannon, Teacher</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In terms of their attitudes towards learning, they seem more resilient and a lot more confident, and they don’t have any tears if they can’t answer any of the questions. They just persevere with it.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” – Zuri, Teacher</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Why do we need physically active learning? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pandemic or no pandemic, all schools face the dual challenges of keeping children healthy through physical activity and ensuring their academic success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structured, active learning programmes enable teachers to cut the time children are expected to sit at a desk whilst still covering the academic curriculum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children respond positively to an active learning environment. It can </span><b>boost confidence and improve academic performance</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical activity in school can be integrated into daily routines rather than positioned as an optional extra.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Why is </b><b><i>Maths on the Move</i></b><b> a good choice? </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aspire has been delivering physically active learning programmes since 2010 and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOTM </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for five years. It’s a well-developed programme that is proven to really work. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The programme has been designed to provide total flexibility to schools. It is suitable for all abilities and can be tailored to suit your pupils’ individual requirements. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i>MOTM</i> has been designed to meet the funding criteria laid out by both the PE and Sports Premium, and the Pupil Premium.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What’s next? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the success of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOTM</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Aspire, MOTM programme creators, are now developing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">English on the Move</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We expect that this programme will be available in schools from January 2022.</span></p>

Suffice to say, lots of things have changed this year. One of these changes, for many of us, was being propelled into a more sedentary lifestyle. The small bits of activity that added up in our daily lives, such as walking to school or work, were no longer the norm.  </span> </div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the lockdown, the number of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">children reaching their activity targets fell from 47% to just 19%.(1)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For adults, the story was a little more complex. Some were doing more exercise than before lockdown whilst others were managing less. However, since the lifting of the restrictions, those meeting the recommended weekly levels trended downwards. 32% during the initial lockdown period (March-May) became 24% by the end of October.(2) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amongst all these many changes, one thing that has remained the same is the importance of regular physical activity in supporting physical and mental health. This relationship is one we are all becoming more familiar with. On average 63% of adults said they used exercise as a tool for supporting their mental health during the lockdown.(3)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this second lockdown, it is important that we remember this relationship, and try to prioritise some form of daily physical activity. With the closing down of sports facilities up and down the country we want to continue to support you with ways to keep active during this difficult time. The benefits of physical activity don&#8217;t end when you step off the court after one of our classes or camps, and we don&#8217;t want our positive impact to do so either. </span></p></div>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>uPlay Sports Challenges</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last lockdown our coaches came up with some challenges for you to have a go at, at home. We’ve added these to a handy YouTube playlist so you can find them all in one place. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LTA: Tennis at home</strong></span> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LTA has put together a wealth of resources including home tennis exercises, activity cards, and challenges to explore qualities such as resilience, perseverance, and passion. We couldn’t recommend their website enough. </span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Body Coach</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We really admire Joe Wicks’ commitment to getting the nation moving during the first lockdown with his fantastic ‘PE with Joe’ series. His YouTube channel has a huge variety of quick workouts for everyone and anyone. </span></p>
<p><strong>Where: <span style="color: #ed1c24;">Search ‘The Body Coach TV’ on YouTube</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Travel to Tokyo</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did your family miss watching the Olympics this summer? Team GB and Paralympics GB have created a Tokyo themed home learning pack with a range of activities for parents to do with their children at home. At Multi-Sports Camp this summer we ran a ‘Design your own Olympic sport’ challenge. Take a look at some of the results below. </span></p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over</span><a href="https://www.uplaysports.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LLAKES-Working-Paper-67_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">two million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have done no schoolwork, or less than an hour a day.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you think that a typical school day is between six and seven hours, combine this with the fact that lockdown lasted for months, the reality hits of just how much learning time has been lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the switch to home-learning comes the risk of</span><a href="https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">widening the attainment gap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, exacerbating existing inequalities as access to resources, home set-up, and level of family support all have a role to play in children’s home learning experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the question is now, what can be done to ensure this impact is not felt long-term?</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>What uPlay Sports are doing?</b></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lockdown has also had a huge impact on children’s physical activity levels. During lockdown 1:</span><span style="font-size: 18px;"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of children getting the recommended 60 minutes of activity a day dropped from <a href="https://www.youthsporttrust.org/evidence-paper-impact-covid-19-restrictions-children-and-young-people" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">47% to 19%</a>. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">36% of children said they had <a href="https://www.youthsporttrust.org/evidence-paper-impact-covid-19-restrictions-children-and-young-people" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">less opportunity to be active</a> because they were not at school.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is clear that schools play an important role in providing a range of opportunities for their pupils so engage in physical activity within the school day, usually through PE lessons and extracurricular clubs. We want to take this a step further and support schools by providing innovative solutions that will have an even bigger impact on their pupils. </span>  </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter the concept of <a href="https://www.uplaysports.co.uk/physically-active-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physically Active Learning</a> (PAL). As well as the numerous physical benefits, <a href="https://www.uplaysports.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Active-lessons-can-boost-childrens-learning-and-health.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> has shown that physical activity can also boost cognitive performance by improving attention, motivation, and enjoyment.  </span>  </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maths on the Move is a maths-based intervention that uses PAL as a driving force for boosting pupils’ confidence and attainment in maths. Not only does MOTM help your pupils reach their 30/30 targets by fitting more activity into the school day, but it is an <a href="https://www.uplaysports.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kids-who-get-moving-may-also-get-better-grades-Business-Insider.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evidence-based</a> tool for improving academic performance.</span></p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government has announced a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">one-off universal £650 million catch-up premium for the 2020 to 2021 academic year.</span>  </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/Covid-19_Resources/Covid-19_support_guide_for_schools.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">guide for schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been published by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), providing evidence-based approaches that effectively support pupils when it comes to the task of catching up.</span>   <strong>A suggested use of the catch-up premium is intervention programmes that:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet a specific need</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can be delivered to small groups</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include regular sessions, maintained over a sustained period</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carefully timetabled</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow for the monitoring of pupil progress.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>Maths on the Move program checks all of the boxes for the suggested use of the catch-up premium</strong>, and it has been newly refreshed to adhere to new COVID-19 guidance. </span>  </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designed in 3 term blocks of 12 weeks of lessons, each lesson objective mirrors that of the maths curriculum enabling MOTM to run alongside classroom teaching. So, there’s your well-targeted, regular sessions over a sustained period of time. </span>  </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experienced educators, learning materials, and an online platform are all part of the </span><a href="https://www.uplaysports.co.uk/physically-active-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOTM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> programme with each child receiving a termly progress report. Monitoring of pupils’ progress: check. Accountability and justification for Ofsted: check and check.</span>  </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>We can discuss timetables with you and create risk assessments that are specific to your setting</strong> and in line with your policies. There’s that required careful timetabling.</span></p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can deliver MOTM in your school and help your pupils get the most out of a Physically Active Learning environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Your safety, pupils’ safety, and our team’s safety is top priority.</strong> We can work with your specific COVID guidelines in addition to the adjustments that have already been made to the programme.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resources required for each lesson are reduced to only those that are essential. Meaning? Sessions can take place outside where possible. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each child will also be given a personal whiteboard and pen in order to limit the sharing of resources (and the debates over who gets to write…).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may all still be shrouded by lots of uncertainty in this global situation, but the need for action to prevent long-term consequences of lost lockdown learning hours remains one certainty we still hold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like to chat through how we can collaborate to best support you and your pupils, send us an email at sophie@uplaysports.co.uk to arrange a convenient time.</span></p></div>
